    Inside your personal folder, there should be subfolders for different phases: Phase 1
    and Phase 2 . You should commit your work inside the corresponding phase folder you
    are working in.
    Example: If you are working on tasks for Phase 1, commit your files to
    main_dir/John/Phase 1/

    <b>Important:</b> Do not commit any work outside of your personal folder or in folders
    assigned to other members. You are only allowed to commit in your own folder
    ( <name_of_member> ).

  <li>
    For each phase, ensure that your work is organized appropriately to make collaboration
    easier and reduce merge conflicts.
